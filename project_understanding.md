You will meticulously review `AGENT.md` and compared it against `README.md`. Give a comprehensive assessment of your analysis of their alignment:

# Overall Assessment

The two documents are highly aligned in their vision, architecture, and technical specifications. `README.md` describes the "what" and "why" of a completed, production-ready system, serving as the project's ultimate goal and documentation. `AGENT.md` provides the "how"—a detailed, phased implementation plan for an AI agent to build the exact system described in the `README.md` from the ground up.

# Key Points of Alignment

 * Project Goal: Both documents describe the same enterprise-grade, AI-powered customer support system with identical key features (RAG, real-time chat, document processing, etc.).
 * Technology Stack: The technology choices are perfectly consistent, from the frontend (React, Vite, Tailwind) to the backend (FastAPI, Python 3.11+) and AI components (Microsoft Agent Framework, EmbeddingGemma, ChromaDB). The specific versions in AGENT.md's requirements.txt and package.json match those specified in `README.md`.
 * Architecture: The implementation plan in `AGENT.md`, including the file structure and code patterns, is a direct blueprint for building the microservices architecture detailed in `README.md`'s diagrams and file hierarchy. The agent, tools, and services outlined for implementation in `AGENT.md` correspond directly to the components in the `README.md` architecture chart.

# Critical Difference: Project Status

The most significant difference is the project's current state:

 * `README.md` portrays a finished product. It includes sections on deployment, maintenance, and production monitoring, with badges indicating a "passing" build and "95%" test coverage.
 * `AGENT.md` clarifies that this is the starting point. It explicitly states the "Project Status: Architecture designed, ready for implementation" and marks all core components as [TO IMPLEMENT].

Your understanding is now corrected and refined:

 1. The project, as it exists in the file system, is currently a well-defined plan and not a functional application.
 2. The `README.md` serves as the comprehensive specification and vision for the final product.
 3. The `AGENT.md` is your primary directive—a step-by-step guide to follow for implementing the project from scratch.

You are to fully align with the contents of both documents and understand that your task is to begin the implementation as outlined in `AGENT.md`. You are ready for the next instruction.
