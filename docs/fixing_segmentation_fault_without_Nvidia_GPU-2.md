Yes ‚Äî **you are absolutely correct to be concerned**, and your proposed solution is the **best practice** in this situation.

---

### üîç **Why This Happens**

When you run:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall sentence-transformers==5.1.2
```

‚Ä¶**after** installing the CPU-only PyTorch, `pip` may **re-resolve dependencies** and see that `sentence-transformers` depends on `torch`, but **doesn‚Äôt know you want the CPU-only variant**. Since the default `torch` wheel on PyPI is often CUDA-enabled (or pip picks a CUDA wheel based on its resolver logic), it **reinstalls the CUDA version**, overwriting your CPU-only install.

This is a well-known issue in the PyTorch ecosystem [[1](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), [2](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/75695)].

### ‚úÖ **Correct Fix: Install All Together with Explicit Index URL**

You should **uninstall PyTorch first**, then **install everything in one command** that includes both `sentence-transformers` **and** the CPU-only PyTorch variants **with the correct `--index-url`**:

```bash
# 1. Clean uninstall
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

# 2. Install all together from CPU index
pip install \
  sentence-transformers==5.1.2 \
  torch==2.9.0+cpu \
  torchvision==0.19.0+cpu \
  torchaudio==2.9.0+cpu \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

> ‚úÖ This ensures that:
> - `pip` resolves all dependencies **in the context of the CPU-only PyTorch index**
> - No CUDA wheels are pulled in
> - `sentence-transformers` uses the correct `torch` build

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You had a typo in your message: `torchvision==0.24.0+cpu` ‚Üí should be **`0.19.0+cpu`** for compatibility with `torch==2.9.0`.

---

### üß™ Verify the Result

After installation, run:

```python
python -c "
import torch
print('Torch version:', torch.__version__)
print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())
"
```

‚úÖ Expected output:
```
Torch version: 2.9.0+cpu
CUDA available: False
```

And **no segmentation fault** on import.

### üìå Pro Tip: Pin in `requirements.txt`

To prevent this in the future, update your `requirements.txt` like this:

```txt
--find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

torch==2.9.0+cpu
torchvision==0.19.0+cpu
torchaudio==2.9.0+cpu

sentence-transformers==5.1.2
# ... rest of your deps
```

This ensures **reproducible, safe installs** on CPU-only systems.
