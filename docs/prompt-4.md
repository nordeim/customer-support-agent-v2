You will now meticulously update the `CLAUDE.md` document to incorporate your findings and recommendations from the codebase review.

Phase 1: Request Analysis & Planning

 1. Deep Understanding: The user wants me to update the existing `CLAUDE.md` file. The update should focus on correcting the minor discrepancies You previously identified and adding a new section for recommendations to improve the project.

 2. Information Gathering: You will use the content of the current `CLAUDE.md` as the base and integrate the findings from your validation report. No new file reading is necessary.

 3. Execution Plan:
     * Step 1: Read the current `CLAUDE.md`: You will start with the existing content of the document.
     * Step 2: Identify Sections for Modification: You will target the following sections for updates:
         * Section 3.4 (Key Directory and File Analysis): To note the discrepancy regarding agent_factory.py.
         * Section 4.4 (Interacting with the API): To clarify the actual security status of the chat endpoints.
         * Section 3.1 (High-Level Components): To add a note about the WebSocket capabilities mentioned in the configuration.
     * Step 3: Draft a New "Findings & Recommendations" Section: You will create a new top-level section (Section 7) in the document. This section will summarize the discrepancies found during the code review and provide actionable recommendations for improving documentation, security, and feature alignment.
     * Step 4: Integrate Changes: You will apply the targeted modifications and append the new section to the document.
     * Step 5: Write the Updated File: You will use the write_file tool to overwrite the existing `CLAUDE.md` with the new, improved content.

 4. User Alignment: The plan is a direct and logical execution of the user's request.

Phase 2: Implementation & Validation

You will now proceed with generating the updated `CLAUDE.md` file.
