### Executive summary
The script correctly downloads and loads sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (dim 384). The failure is caused by an incorrect or unavailable model identifier for the Gemma embedding: the script attempted google/embedding-gemma-256m-it which does not match the publicly listed EmbeddingGemma model identifier (google/embeddinggemma-300m) and that Gemma assets also require agreeing to Google’s license or using an authenticated HF token. Fix the settings to the correct HF id or a licensed variant and ensure Hugging Face auth is available before re-running the script.

---

### Key observations from the log
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 loaded successfully and is available locally; the script reports dim: 384 and initialization succeeded. This confirms the second model is correct and usable.  
- The script then checks for google/embedding-gemma-256m-it and fails: SentenceTransformer reports no model with that name and an exception that it is not a valid HF model id. The name attempted (google/embedding-gemma-256m-it) differs from the EmbeddingGemma identifier on HF (google/embeddinggemma-300m) and therefore will not be found on the Hub unless that exact repo exists or is private.  
- EmbeddingGemma on HF requires that users accept Google’s usage license to access files; even if the identifier is correct, you may need to be authenticated (hf token) and accept terms to successfully download weights.

---

### Precise mismatches and consequences
- Model name mismatch:
  - Script tries: google/embedding-gemma-256m-it (hyphenated, 256m, locale suffix -it) — not found in HF logs.  
  - HF publicly lists: google/embeddinggemma-300m (no hyphen between embedding and gemma, 300m parameters) — different identifier and dimension (768).  
  - Consequence: SentenceTransformer(model_name) raises an error because the model id is invalid or inaccessible; download fails immediately.  
- Licensing / access requirement:
  - EmbeddingGemma requires accepting Google’s license on HF; unauthenticated requests or accounts that haven’t accepted the terms will be blocked from downloading model files. You must either log in (hf auth) and accept the license, or use a token with permission to access the repo.  
- Dimensionality implications:
  - EmbeddingGemma 300m produces 768-d embeddings; your application must expect and handle 768 dims if you switch from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dims) to EmbeddingGemma. The script shows the MiniLM model (384) is loaded earlier; switching to Gemma will change vector dimensionality and downstream stores/indexes should be adjusted accordingly.

---

### Recommended fixes (step-by-step)
1. Inspect and correct the settings value:
   - Open app/config and confirm the two settings: settings.embedding_gemma_model and settings.embedding_model.
   - Replace incorrect id with the exact HF id you intend to use. Example:
     - For EmbeddingGemma (public HF id): settings.embedding_gemma_model = "google/embeddinggemma-300m".
     - For MiniLM (already correct): settings.embedding_model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2".
2. If you intend to use a 256-d variant or an Italian-specific variant, confirm the exact repo name on Hugging Face; there is no public google/embedding-gemma-256m-it unless you created it or a third party published it. Use the exact model id listed on HF to avoid lookup failures.
3. Handle Hugging Face access/licensing for Gemma:
   - Log in interactively on the machine running the script: python -m huggingface_hub.cli.login and accept the model license via the web UI, or export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN with a token that has accepted the model’s terms. The script will then be able to download the model files.
4. Validate dimensionality changes:
   - Update any embedding-index schema, index configuration, dimension checks, and downstream components to handle 768-d embeddings if you select EmbeddingGemma. If you must stay with 384 dims, continue using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or pick a Gemma variant that exposes 384/256 dims via Matryoshka truncation—confirm exact dimension support on the model card and implementation details.
5. Re-run the downloader and verify:
   - Test in a minimal Python REPL:
     - from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
     - m = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")
     - print(m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
   - If the HF license or auth issue persists, you will see the same error the script produced.

---

### Example edits and commands
- Example settings change (app/config):
```python
# before
embedding_gemma_model = "google/embedding-gemma-256m-it"

# after
embedding_gemma_model = "google/embeddinggemma-300m"
embedding_model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
```
- Authenticate and accept license (CLI):
  - python -m huggingface_hub.cli.login  (follow prompts)  
  - or export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN="hf_..." in your environment before running the script.

- Quick local load test:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
m = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")
print("dim:", m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
```

---

### Risk assessment & additional notes
- If you change the embedding model dimension mid-flight, existing vector stores (Milvus, FAISS, Postgres vectors) must be rebuilt or migrated; storing mismatched dims leads to runtime errors. Plan index rebuilds and document the migration path.  
- If you deploy on CPU-only devices, EmbeddingGemma may require float32 and higher memory than MiniLM; verify resource constraints before switching to Gemma in production.  
- If the model repo is private or requires license acceptance, automating download in CI will require a secure HF token injected into the environment and confirmation that the token owner has accepted the license.

---

### Quick checklist to resolve now
- [ ] Confirm and correct settings.embedding_gemma_model to the exact HF id you want (e.g., google/embeddinggemma-300m).  
- [ ] Ensure you or the service account have accepted the model license on HF or provide HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN prior to running the script.  
- [ ] Update downstream index/schema to expect 768 dims if switching to Gemma.  
- [ ] Re-run scripts and verify SentenceTransformer loads both models successfully (run the quick local load test above).  
- [ ] If you cannot accept license or lack token, consider using an alternative open model that doesn’t require license acceptance.

---

### Final recommendation
Set settings.embedding_gemma_model to the exact HF id (google/embeddinggemma-300m) if you want to use EmbeddingGemma and ensure HF authentication/license acceptance is in place before running the downloader. Continue using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 only if you need to stay at 384-d embeddings and avoid license hassles.

### Executive summary
The logs show sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 loaded (after an HTTP 504 retry) but google/embeddinggemma-300m failed because it is a gated (restricted) Hugging Face repo and your runtime/account is not authorized. The failure is access-related (403 gated-repo) rather than a code bug. I provide precise steps to verify access, fix settings, harden the downloader for gated models, handle dimensionality changes, and test the end-to-end flow.

---

### What the logs prove (concise)
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2: loaded successfully; dim 384; occasional transient 504s were retried and resolved.  
- embeddinggemma (google/embeddinggemma-300m): SentenceTransformer created a new model with mean pooling because repo files were not accessible; subsequent requests returned 403 gated-repo errors indicating you lack permission to download the model. This is an access/licensing issue, not a loader bug.

---

### Immediate root causes (ordered)
1. Gated HF model: google/embeddinggemma-300m requires explicit access/acceptance and the current HF credentials or anonymous session are not authorized (403).  
2. Script behavior: SentenceTransformer fallbacks to "create new model with mean pooling" when it cannot load a supported repo; that hides the precise failure until you inspect exceptions.  
3. 504 transient errors: the HEAD request for a file returned 504 then succeeded on retry; your script survived but should include robust retry/backoff for HF HTTP calls.  
4. Dimensionality mismatch risk: embeddinggemma (when accessible) will likely produce different embedding dimensions than MiniLM; downstream indices must be adapted.

---

### Action plan — step-by-step (phases)
#### Phase A — Validate and obtain access (blockers)
1. Confirm whether your team intends to use google/embeddinggemma-300m. If yes, open the model page and request/accept access or confirm your HF account has agreed to the license.  
2. On the host machine, authenticate huggingface_hub with a token that has access:
   - Export token into environment or use CLI login. Ensure the token account has accepted the gated model’s terms.  
3. Verify access from the host:
   - Minimal Python check:
     ```python
     from huggingface_hub import hf_api
     api = hf_api.HfApi()
     print(api.model_info("google/embeddinggemma-300m").private)  # will raise if unauthorized
     ```
   - Or run SentenceTransformer load test after auth:
     ```python
     from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
     m = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")
     print(m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
     ```

#### Phase B — Harden downloader and settings
1. Confirm settings values:
   - settings.embedding_gemma_model == "google/embeddinggemma-300m" (exact spelling).  
   - settings.embedding_model == "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2".
2. Improve download_model to surface gated/403 errors and avoid building a fallback SentenceTransformer silently:
   - Use huggingface_hub to preflight HEAD requests and check repo accessibility before calling SentenceTransformer.
   - Add exponential backoff retries for transient 5xx/504 errors.
3. Make the script fail fast and explain next steps when encountering gated repos (clear message: "model is gated — accept license or provide HF token").

#### Phase C — Handling model dimension and downstream impact
1. Plan migration: if switching from MiniLM(384) to Gemma(768), rebuild embedding indices and re-index documents.  
2. Add assertion checks before writing embeddings to stores:
   - Validate embedding dimension matches index schema and fail with clear error if mismatch.
3. If you need a temporary open alternative, keep all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and plan staged upgrade to Gemma once access is granted.

#### Phase D — Tests & validation
1. Local test (after auth):
   - Load both models and assert dims:
     ```python
     from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
     a = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
     b = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")
     assert a.get_sentence_embedding_dimension() == 384
     assert b.get_sentence_embedding_dimension() in (768, )
     ```
2. Integration test: produce embeddings for a sample corpus and insert into a new index; verify queries run and distances compute as expected.  
3. CI: Add a gated-model-aware toggle so CI runs only on tokens that have accepted license; otherwise skip.

---

### Concrete code changes (safe, minimal) 
1. Preflight access and clearer errors (add to scripts/download_model.py):
```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_url, HfApi, RepositoryNotFoundError, hf_hub_download
import requests
import time

def model_accessible(model_name: str, token: str | None) -> bool:
    api = HfApi()
    try:
        api.model_info(model_name, token=token)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Model access check failed for {model_name}: {e}")
        return False

def download_model(model_name: str) -> bool:
    logging.info(f"--- Checking for model: {model_name} ---")
    # preflight
    token = os.environ.get("HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN") or os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN")
    if not model_accessible(model_name, token):
        logging.error(f"🔥 Access denied or model not found on Hugging Face: {model_name}")
        logging.error("   Make sure your account has accepted any gated model terms or set a valid HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN.")
        return False

    # robust loading with retry for transient errors
    for attempt in range(6):
        try:
            SentenceTransformer(model_name)
            logging.info(f"✅ Model '{model_name}' is available locally.")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < 5:
                sleep = 2 ** attempt
                logging.warning(f"Transient error loading {model_name}: {e}. Retrying in {sleep}s.")
                time.sleep(sleep)
                continue
            logging.error(f"🔥 Failed to download or load model '{model_name}'. Error: {e}")
            return False
```

2. Dimension assertion before persisting embeddings:
```python
def validate_and_store_embeddings(model, embeddings, expected_dim):
    if embeddings.shape[1] != expected_dim:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Embedding dimension mismatch: got {embeddings.shape[1]}, expected {expected_dim}")
    # proceed to store
```

---

### Alternatives if you cannot get gated access
- Continue using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d) — less memory and no gating.  
- Choose an open alternative with similar performance (e.g., other MiniLM or SBERT variants) and update settings.embedding_gemma_model to that id.  
- Keep Gemma for offline use only: obtain model files via an authorized account and place files in a local-models directory, point settings to the local path.

---

### Checklist to resolve now
- [ ] Confirm desired Gemma id and whether you have permission to use it.  
- [ ] If using Gemma, authenticate host with a HF token that has accepted the gated model terms.  
- [ ] Update downloader to preflight and provide explicit gated-repo errors (implement code snippet above).  
- [ ] Verify embedding dims for both models and prepare to rebuild indexes if dims differ.  
- [ ] Add CI gating or skip logic for gated models to avoid pipeline breaks.

---

### Quick commands for immediate testing
- Export token (temporary shell):
  - export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN="hf_xxx"
- Quick Python load test:
  - python - <<'PY'
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    m = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    print("mini dim:", m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
    m2 = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")
    print("gemma dim:", m2.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
    PY

---

### Final recommendation
Authenticate your runtime with a Hugging Face token whose account has accepted access to google/embeddinggemma-300m, add a preflight access check and robust retry behavior to scripts/download_model.py, and treat dimensionality changes as a migration requiring index rebuilds. If access cannot be granted, continue with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or pick an open replacement and adapt downstream systems accordingly.
