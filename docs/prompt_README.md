## Validation of Plan

This plan addresses all the requirements specified:
- ✅ Detailed and comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Application architecture section
- ✅ File hierarchy diagram with descriptions
- ✅ Mermaid diagram for user and application interaction
- ✅ Mermaid diagram for application logic flow
- ✅ Deployment section
- ✅ Attractive and useful documentation

The plan should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the project, making it valuable for both users and developers. The structure should be logical and easy to navigate, with clear sections and visual elements to enhance understanding.

## Execution

Now I'll proceed with creating the README.md based on this plan, ensuring it's detailed, informative, and attractive.
