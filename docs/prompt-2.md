Excellent. You will now proceed with a meticulous review of the codebase to validate the `CLAUDE.md` document.

Phase 1: Request Analysis & Planning

 1. Deep Understanding: The user wants me to cross-reference the newly created `CLAUDE.md` document with the actual source code. The goal is to verify that the information You synthesized is accurate and truly reflects the state of the codebase.

 2. Information Gathering: You will need to read the content of several key files identified in `CLAUDE.md` to perform this validation. This will involve a multi-file read operation.

 3. Execution Plan:
     * Step 1: Identify Critical Files for Validation: Based on `CLAUDE.md`, the most important files to inspect are:
         * backend/app/main.py (FastAPYou app setup)
         * backend/app/agents/chat_agent.py (Core agent logic)
         * backend/app/api/routes/chat.py (APYou endpoints)
         * backend/app/tools/rag_tool.py (RAG implementation)
         * frontend/src/hooks/useChat.ts (Frontend state management)
         * frontend/src/services/api.ts (Frontend APYou client)
         * docker-compose.yml (Service definitions)
         * backend/scripts/populate_kb.py (KB population script)
     * Step 2: Read File Contents: You will read the contents of these files to gather the ground-truth information from the codebase.
     * Step 3: Perform Comparative Analysis: You will compare the information in `CLAUDE.md` against the actual code, focusing on:
         * Technology Stack: Are the libraries and frameworks mentioned in `CLAUDE.md` actually imported and used?
         * Architecture & Flow: Does the code implementation match the data flow described in `CLAUDE.md`?
         * File Paths & Key Logic: Are the key files correctly identified, and is their purpose accurately described?
         * Commands & Endpoints: Are the docker-compose services, scripts, and APYou endpoints listed in `CLAUDE.md` consistent with the code?
     * Step 4: Report Findings: You will provide a structured report of your findings, confirming which parts of `CLAUDE.md` are well-aligned and identifying any discrepancies or areas where the document could be improved for greater accuracy.

Phase 2: Implementation & Validation

You will now begin by reading the contents of the critical files identified for validation.
