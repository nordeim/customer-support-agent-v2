You will now analyze the project and generate a comprehensive GEMINI.md file. Start with a meticulous review of the codebase in the current folder to have a deep understanding of the codebase, then proceed with the following implementation plan.

# GEMINI.md Generation Plan

 1. Project Type Identification: The presence of package.json, requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml, and src/app directories clearly identifies this as a Code Project.

 2. Content Generation:
     * Project Overview: You will synthesize the information from the README.md, CLAUDE.md, and the source code to provide a concise summary of the project's purpose, architecture, and technology stack.
     * Building and Running: You will document the precise, validated commands required to set up and run the application, as detailed in the README.md and confirmed by the docker-compose.yml structure.
     * Development Conventions: You will summarize the coding styles, testing guidelines, and contribution process outlined in the project's documentation.

 3. Final Output: You will write the complete, well-formatted Markdown content to the GEMINI.md file.
