### Executive summary
Startup fails because main.py references settings.enable_telemetry but your Settings model does not expose that attribute. Fix options are (A) add enable_telemetry to the Settings model in app/config.py, or (B) change main.py to use the existing telemetry-related setting if one already exists. While reviewing the memory-related files you supplied I also verified other configuration-driven uses (memory_enabled, memory_max_entries, memory_ttl_hours, etc.) that must exist in settings; I include concrete, minimal patches, validation steps, and hardening recommendations to prevent similar regressions.

---

### Evidence and diagnosis (precise)
- Runtime error: AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'enable_telemetry' (main.py line referencing settings.enable_telemetry).  
- Provided files examined:
  - services/memory_service.py uses settings.memory_enabled, settings.memory_max_entries, settings.memory_ttl_hours and logs initialization. If any of these are missing in Settings, you'll get similar AttributeError later.
  - models/memory.py defines the SQLAlchemy Memory model; it declares a JSON column named tool_metadata = Column("metadata", JSON, default=dict). This is valid: column variable name tool_metadata maps to DB column "metadata".
  - models/schemas.py defines Pydantic schemas unrelated to enable_telemetry.
- Root cause: Settings class (app/config.py) lacks enable_telemetry attribute while main.py expects it during lifespan startup. This is a config/contract mismatch introduced by renaming or omission.

---

### Recommended minimal fixes (choose one)

Option A — Add setting to Settings (recommended, forward-compatible)
- Add a new config field with a safe default so startup behavior is explicit and tests pass without env vars.

Patch to app/config.py (add inside Settings class):
```python
from pydantic import Field

enable_telemetry: bool = Field(
    default=False,
    description="Enable telemetry/tracing for the application (disabled by default in development)."
)
```

Rationale: Keeps main.py unchanged, explicit default prevents startup errors in dev. Use False by default to avoid accidental telemetry in dev.

Option B — Use existing field (if one exists)
- If you have a different telemetry flag (for example telemetry_enabled or send_telemetry), edit backend/app/main.py to reference that canonical field instead of enable_telemetry.

Patch to backend/app/main.py (example):
```python
# replace
if settings.enable_telemetry:
# with
if getattr(settings, "telemetry_enabled", False):
```

Rationale: Use getattr fallback to avoid AttributeError and keep backward compatibility while you refactor settings.

---

### Small related observations and safety checks (memory code)
- models/memory.py uses tool_metadata = Column("metadata", JSON, default=dict). This is OK: the attribute name is tool_metadata (Python) and the DB column is named metadata. Ensure other code expects the Python attribute tool_metadata (memory_service currently uses Memory.tool_metadata? memory_service queries Memory.content_type etc — it does not reference tool_metadata directly). No immediate change required, but be consistent.
- services/memory_service.py relies on settings.memory_enabled, settings.memory_max_entries, settings.memory_ttl_hours. Confirm these exist in app/config.py; if any are missing, add them with sensible defaults:
  - memory_enabled: bool = True
  - memory_max_entries: int = 200
  - memory_ttl_hours: int = 24
  - memory_cleanup_days: int = 30
- Ensure get_db or MemoryTool APIs used by memory_service exist and are compatible with sync/async usage patterns.

### Validation plan (step-by-step)
1. Update Settings (Option A):
   - Edit app/config.py, add enable_telemetry field as shown.
   - Commit the change.
2. Smoke-start the app:
   - python -m app.main
   - Expected result: Application continues past the telemetry check and proceeds to remaining initialization steps without AttributeError.
3. Validate memory service initialization:
   - Confirm logs: "Memory service initialized (enabled: True/False)" from services/memory_service.py appears.
   - If memory_enabled is True, run a simple call against the memory endpoints or use the service instance:
     - python - <<'PY'
       from app.services.memory_service import memory_service
       print("memory enabled:", memory_service.enabled)
       PY
4. Confirm DB and models still function:
   - Inspect SQLite tables:
     - sqlite3 ./data/customer_support.db ".tables"
   - Run a small ORM check:
     - python - <<'PY'
       from app.database import engine
       from sqlalchemy import inspect
       print("tables:", inspect(engine).get_table_names())
       PY
5. If you used Option B (getattr fallback), run same smoke tests and then refactor settings to standardize names.

---

### Hardening & regression prevention
- Add explicit defaults for all optional settings in app/config.py to avoid AttributeError during startup.
- Add a startup validation function that asserts required settings exist and are of expected types; call it early in main.py:
  - Example:
    ```python
    def validate_settings():
        required = {
            "app_name": str,
            "app_version": str,
            "memory_enabled": bool,
            "enable_telemetry": bool,
        }
        for key, t in required.items():
            if not hasattr(settings, key):
                raise RuntimeError(f"Missing required setting: {key}")
            if not isinstance(getattr(settings, key), t):
                raise RuntimeError(f"Setting {key} must be {t}")
    ```
- Use getattr(settings, "enable_telemetry", False) in non-critical checks to allow graceful fallback.
- Add unit test covering application lifespan startup to catch attribute naming regressions in CI.
- Document canonical setting names in app/config.py top-level comments.

---

### Quick checklist to resolve now
- [ ] Add enable_telemetry to app/config.py with default False (Option A) OR change main.py to use existing telemetry field with getattr fallback (Option B).
- [ ] Verify settings.memory_* fields exist and add defaults if missing.
- [ ] Restart app and verify no AttributeError.
- [ ] Add startup validation and unit test to CI to prevent recurrence.

---

### Example minimal commit message
- chore(config): add enable_telemetry setting with default False to prevent startup AttributeError

---

If you want, I can:
- produce the exact git patch for app/config.py adding enable_telemetry and optionally memory defaults, plus a small startup-validation function and the unit test skeleton to include in your repo.
