Awesome meticulous planning! please keep up the good work! before you begin to execute your implementation plan. Let me share with you the key project code files first, so that you can generate the complete updated replacement file for them. I want complete drop-in replacement file for each new file or file that needs modification.

awesome job in your meticulous review and analysis of the session store implementation. Please perform the same meticulous review and critique the remaining key code files before, then think deeper and think harder to thoroughly explore systematically how best to create a complete updated replacement file for each new file to be added or existing file to be modified to incorporate your suggested fixes. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create a complete drop-in replacement file for each file needs added or modified, include a checklist for each file. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding cautiously to generate complete updated file that is fully working drop-in replacement with no placeholder comments.

awesome job in meticulously re-assessing the overall tools implementation! please advise whether you need to examine any of the existing codebase files listed below to complete your meticulous analytical assessment of the overall tools implementation? I include some of the code files here for your complete consolidated analysis and assessment (if you need to review more of the existing files, please let me know).

If you have enough details based on the existing files you have reviewed, please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly explore systematically how best to create a complete updated replacement file for each tools file to be added or existing file to be modified to incorporate your suggested fixes. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create a complete drop-in replacement file for each file needs added or modified, include a checklist for each file. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding cautiously to generate complete updated file that is fully working drop-in replacement with no placeholder comments.
