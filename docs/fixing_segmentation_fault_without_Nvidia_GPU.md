Yes, **the segmentation fault you are experiencing is very likely due to your system lacking an NVIDIA GPU while your `requirements.txt` pulls in a CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch by default**.

Here‚Äôs a meticulous analysis grounded in your environment, project context, and external evidence:

---

### üîç **Root Cause Diagnosis**

1. **Your Hardware**: You have an older ATI (AMD) display adapter, which is **not supported by CUDA**. PyTorch‚Äôs default `pip install torch` (as in your `requirements.txt`) **installs the CUDA-enabled version** if it detects a compatible environment or if no explicit CPU-only flag is used .

2. **PyTorch Behavior on Non-CUDA Systems**: When a CUDA-enabled PyTorch binary is run on a machine **without a compatible NVIDIA GPU**, it can lead to **low-level runtime errors**, including **segmentation faults** during import or tensor operations‚Äîeven if you never explicitly call `.cuda()` [[5], [21]].

3. **Evidence from the Ecosystem**:
   - Multiple reports confirm that **importing `torch` or using `sentence-transformers` (which depends on `transformers` and `torch`) can cause segfaults on CPU-only machines** when the installed PyTorch build expects CUDA [[5], [11], [12], [17]].
   - A common fix is to **reinstall PyTorch in CPU-only mode** [[21], [26]].

4. **Your Stack Confirms the Risk**:
   - You are using:
     - `torch==2.9.0`
     - `sentence-transformers==5.1.2`
     - `transformers==4.57.1`
   - These libraries **load PyTorch at startup**, and if the PyTorch binary was compiled with CUDA support but no GPU is present (or the driver/runtime is missing), **the process can crash with a segmentation fault before any Python-level error is raised** .

### üõ†Ô∏è **Recommended Solution: Install CPU-Only PyTorch**

You must **replace your current PyTorch installation** with the **CPU-only variant**.

#### Step-by-step Fix:

1. **Uninstall current PyTorch**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

2. **Install CPU-only PyTorch 2.9.0** (explicitly):
   ```bash
   pip install torch==2.9.0+cpu torchvision==0.19.0+cpu torchaudio==2.9.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```
   > This ensures you get the **CPU-optimized wheel** that avoids CUDA runtime dependencies entirely [[25], [26]].

3. **(Optional but Recommended)**: Also reinstall `sentence-transformers` to ensure clean dependency resolution:
   ```bash
   pip install --force-reinstall sentence-transformers==5.1.2
   ```

4. **Verify the Fix**:
   ```python
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   2.9.0+cpu
   False
   ```
   And **no segmentation fault**.

### üß™ Why This Happens (Technical Deep Dive)

- PyTorch distributes **multiple wheel variants**: `cu118`, `cu121`, `cpu`, etc.
- When you run `pip install torch==2.9.0` **without specifying an index URL**, pip may select a **CUDA-enabled wheel** based on its resolver logic‚Äîeven on a non-NVIDIA system‚Äîbecause the metadata doesn‚Äôt always enforce hardware checks at install time .
- At **runtime**, PyTorch attempts to initialize CUDA context (e.g., via `libcuda.so`), which fails silently or causes a **segfault** if the driver or GPU is absent .
- Libraries like `sentence-transformers` trigger this on import because they load `transformers`, which loads `torch`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: AMD (ROCm) support exists in PyTorch 2.9 , but **only for specific modern AMD GPUs** (e.g., MI200 series). Your ‚Äúold ATI adapter‚Äù is **not supported**, so **CPU-only is the only safe path**.

---

### ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [ ] PyTorch installed from CPU index URL
- [ ] `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `False`
- [ ] `python -m app.main` starts without segfault
- [ ] RAG and embedding features still work (they will, just slower)

### üìå Final Recommendation

Update your `requirements.txt` to **explicitly use the CPU-only PyTorch variant** to prevent this issue for other developers:

```txt
# CPU-only PyTorch (for non-NVIDIA systems)
--find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
torch==2.9.0+cpu
torchvision==0.19.0+cpu
torchaudio==2.9.0+cpu

# Rest of your deps...
fastapi==0.116.1
...
sentence-transformers==5.1.2
```

This ensures **reproducible, safe installs** across heterogeneous development environments.
