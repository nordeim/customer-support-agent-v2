### Executive summary
The final run shows sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B loaded successfully. The expected google/embeddinggemma-300m is no longer attempted. This indicates your application settings or model-selection logic changed between runs and Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B replaced the Gemma entry. Confirm and lock settings to the exact HF IDs you intend, add validation that loaded models match expectations, and add explicit fail-fast checks so unexpected models cannot silently be used.

---

### What the logs prove
- **Loaded models**: Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is available locally and sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is available locally.  
- **Missing from logs**: google/embeddinggemma-300m is not attempted in this run.  
- **Implication**: The downloader now loads Qwen as the first embedding model. The script behavior changed either because settings.embedding_gemma_model was updated to Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B or model selection logic substituted it at runtime.

---

### Immediate actions to verify and correct source of truth
- Inspect app/config or environment variables immediately for the two embedding settings and confirm their current values.
  - Check code locations: app/config.py, environment variables HUGGINGFACE_MODEL, EMBEDDING_MODEL, EMBEDDING_GEMMA_MODEL, or other config loaders used in startup.
  - Run a one-line check in your project root:
    - python -c "from app.config import settings; print('gemma=', settings.embedding_gemma_model); print('embed=', settings.embedding_model)"
- Lock settings to exact intended HF ids if your goal is the two original models:
  - settings.embedding_gemma_model = "google/embeddinggemma-300m"
  - settings.embedding_model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
- If Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is deliberate, document that decision and adjust downstream expectations for embedding dimension and runtime resource usage.

---

### Concrete verification commands and quick tests
- Confirm loaded model dimensions from Python REPL:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
for name in ("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2","Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B","google/embeddinggemma-300m"):
    try:
        m = SentenceTransformer(name)
        print(name, "dim:", m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension())
    except Exception as e:
        print(name, "failed:", e)
PY
```
- Confirm settings used by the downloader at runtime by adding a simple logging line at start of main in scripts/download_model.py:
```python
logging.info(f"Using models from settings: gemma={settings.embedding_gemma_model}; embed={settings.embedding_model}")
```

---

### Safe code hardening to prevent silent substitution
- Add explicit model-name assertion in download_model to fail fast if the loaded model name does not match the requested id:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
def download_model(model_name: str) -> bool:
    logging.info(f"--- Checking for model: {model_name} ---")
    try:
        model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
        if getattr(model, "name", None) and model_name not in model.name and model_name not in str(model):
            logging.error(f"Loaded model does not match requested id {model_name}; loaded {getattr(model,'name',None)}")
            return False
        logging.info(f"âœ… Model '{model_name}' is available locally.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"ðŸ”¥ Failed to download or load model '{model_name}'. Error: {e}")
        return False
```
- Add a startup validation that asserts expected dimensions for each configured model and stops startup if mismatched:
```python
expected_dims = {"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2":384, "google/embeddinggemma-300m":768}
for model_id, expected in expected_dims.items():
    try:
        m = SentenceTransformer(model_id)
        if m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension() != expected:
            raise SystemExit(f"Embedding dimension mismatch for {model_id}: got {m.get_sentence_embedding_dimension()}, expected {expected}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise SystemExit(f"Failed to validate model {model_id}: {e}")
```

---

### Migration and downstream considerations
- **Dimension changes**: Qwen and Gemma have different embedding dims than MiniLM. Rebuild vector indices when switching model dims.  
- **Resource usage**: Qwen and Gemma use more memory and CPU than MiniLM on CPU-only environments. Validate host capacity.  
- **Access gating**: If you revert to google/embeddinggemma-300m, ensure HF token with accepted license is present in environment before running the downloader.

---

### Minimal checklist to resolve now
- [ ] Confirm current values in app/config and environment variables for embedding models.  
- [ ] If you want Gemma, set settings.embedding_gemma_model to "google/embeddinggemma-300m" and ensure HF access token with license acceptance is available.  
- [ ] If Qwen was unintentional, find where it was introduced and revert to the intended HF id.  
- [ ] Add the logging and validation snippets above to the downloader to prevent silent substitutions.  
- [ ] Run the dimension verification test and rebuild your vector index if dimensions differ.

---

### Final recommendation
Immediately check and lock the authoritative settings source. Add fail-fast validation in scripts/download_model.py so the process aborts when the requested HF id does not load or when an unexpected model is used. Re-run the verification commands above and proceed with index rebuilds if embedding dimensions changed.
