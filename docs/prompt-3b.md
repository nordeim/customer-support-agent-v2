awesome job with your rigorous and meticulous approach! please keep up the good work! Please analyze the project and generate a comprehensive `AGENT.md` file. Start with a meticulous review of the codebase envisioned after completion according to your implementation plan, and use your deep understanding of the codebase (to be), then proceed with the following implementation plan.

# AGENT.md Generation Plan

Purpose: To onboard an AI coding agent like `Claude Code` and `Codex` to be able to start working on a phase in the codebase execution plan independently with minimal need for human intervention and with minimal rework required subsequently. 

 1. Project Type Identification: The presence of package.json, requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml, and src/app directories clearly identifies this as a Code Project.

 2. Content Generation:
     * Project Overview: You will synthesize the information from the README.md, your implementation plan, and the (envisioned) codebase to provide a concise summary of the project's purpose, architecture, and technology stack.
     * Building and Running: You will document the precise, validated commands required to set up and run the application, as detailed in the README.md and confirmed by the docker-compose.yml structure.
     * Development Conventions: You will summarize the coding styles, testing guidelines, and contribution process outlined in the project's documentation.

 3. Final Output: You will write the complete, well-formatted Markdown content to the AGENT.md file.
