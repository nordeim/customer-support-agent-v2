### Executive summary
The startup error is caused by a mismatch between the attribute used in app.main and the attribute defined in app.config. main.py reads settings.version but config.py exposes settings.app_version. Fix either by changing main.py to use settings.app_version (minimal, safe) or by adding a computed property version in Settings that returns app_version (backwards-compatible). I recommend the minimal change to main.py for clarity and to avoid adding implicit aliases. I provide a precise change, validation steps, and a phased plan to harden configuration attribute usage to prevent regressions.

---

### Evidence and exact mismatch
- main.py logs the startup using settings.version which does not exist in the Settings model; the traceback pinpoints the failing expression settings.version in the lifespan startup code (line shown in runtime trace).  
- config.py defines the version field as app_version: str = Field(default="1.0.0", description="Application version") and exposes settings.app_version elsewhere (root endpoint uses settings.app_version).  
- Conclusion: code expects attribute name "version" while the Settings object only defines "app_version", causing AttributeError at startup (Observed runtime error: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'version').

---

### Recommended fix (minimal, authoritative)
Change the single usage in backend/app/main.py from settings.version to settings.app_version.

Patch (exact replacement):
- File: backend/app/main.py
- Locate in lifespan startup block:
  - Current: logger.info(f"Starting {settings.app_name} v{settings.version}").
  - Replace with: logger.info(f"Starting {settings.app_name} v{settings.app_version}").

Rationale: this directly uses the canonical property name defined in the Settings model, avoids introducing duplication, and is consistent with other parts of the codebase that reference settings.app_version (e.g., root endpoint).

---

### Backwards-compatible alternative (if you prefer alias)
If other code or external callers may expect settings.version, add a computed property to Settings in config.py:

Add to backend/app/config.py inside class Settings:
```python
@property
def version(self) -> str:
    "Backward-compatible alias for app_version."
    return self.app_version
```

Rationale: creates an explicit alias while keeping canonical field app_version. Use only if you need to preserve compatibility for other modules that may have used settings.version historically.

---

### Hardening and prevention measures (recommended)
1. Add runtime validation at settings creation to assert canonical attribute names are present (fail fast with clear message). Example: in get_settings(), after settings = Settings(), assert hasattr(settings, "app_version") else raise clear error referencing config contract.  
2. Add a unit test in the test suite to import app.main and instantiate the FastAPI app with settings mocked to ensure the lifespan startup log line executes without AttributeError. This catches attribute renames early in PRs.  
3. Add linter or pre-commit check: scan for usages of settings.version and settings.app_version; flag inconsistent use. Prefer single canonical name.  
4. Add an explicit comment in config.py documenting canonical names (app_name, app_version) and discourage ad-hoc aliases.

---

### Step-by-step fix plan and checklist
1. Edit file backend/app/main.py:
   - Replace settings.version with settings.app_version in the lifespan startup logger line.
2. Run quick local smoke test:
   - Command: python -m app.main
   - Expect: application to progress past the lifespan startup logging line without AttributeError.
3. Run the existing test suite (if present) or at minimum run a small script to import settings:
   - python - <<'PY'
     from app.config import settings
     print(settings.app_name, settings.app_version)
     PY
   - Expect: prints app name and version (no exceptions).
4. Optional: add alias property in config.py if broader compatibility is needed (see alternative above).
5. Add a unit test to cover startup lifespan behavior and a CI lint rule to enforce consistent settings attribute usage.

Checklist:
- [ ] Replace settings.version -> settings.app_version in backend/app/main.py.  
- [ ] Run the app locally and confirm startup completes.  
- [ ] Add test covering settings attribute usage and app startup.  
- [ ] (Optional) Add version property alias to Settings if required.  
- [ ] Commit and push the fix with a short explanatory commit message.

---

### Exact code context references
- The failing expression is in the lifespan function of backend/app/main.py (uses settings.version).  
- The Settings model defines app_version as the version field and root endpoint already uses settings.app_version, confirming the canonical name is app_version.

---

### Quick commands to apply and verify the minimal fix
1. Apply the change (in project root):
```bash
git apply <<'PATCH'
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: backend/app/main.py
@@
-    logger.info(f"Starting {settings.app_name} v{settings.version}")
+    logger.info(f"Starting {settings.app_name} v{settings.app_version}")
*** End Patch
PATCH
```
2. Run startup smoke:
```bash
python -m app.main
# expect no AttributeError and logs showing Starting <app_name> v<app_version>
```
3. Run simple settings check:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
from app.config import settings
print("app_name:", settings.app_name)
print("app_version:", settings.app_version)
PY
```

---

### Risk assessment
- Low risk for the minimal change: it is a single-line edit aligning code with the declared Settings API. No downstream changes needed because other code already uses settings.app_version.  
- If you choose the alias approach, added property is low-risk but may mask future inconsistent namingâ€”prefer to standardize on app_version and enforce via tests/linting.

---

### Next steps I will assume and act on
- I assume you want the minimal, explicit fix to main.py and then to verify via local startup. I will not make further edits unless you ask me to patch files or implement the optional alias and tests.
